Problem 2: Randomly generate two integers between 1 and 15 inclusively, let's call them a and b. Then randomly generate a number between 1 and 4, call it operation.
If the value of operation is 1, then prompt the user to enter the result of the expression a+b
If the value of operation is 2, then prompt the user to enter the result of the expression a*b
If the value of operation is 3, then prompt the user to enter the result of the expression a-b
If the value of operation is 4, then prompt the user to enter the result of the expression a/b
